# Explanations
## Question 1:
The temperature conversion program does temperature conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit and formats the outputs to 2 decimal places.
the program prompts the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, performs the conversion using the formula F = (C * 9/5) + 32, and displays the result in Fahrenheit with 2 decimal places.
## Question 2:
The calculator program uses a do-while loop to continuously display a menu and perform the calculation until the user decides to exit.
the program prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator, performs the calculation based on the operator, and displays the result. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit by entering 'n' when prompted.
## Question 3:
q3's program calculates the factorial of a given number or the power of a given base to the given exponent. It demonstrated function reuse and function recursion with factorial.
the program prompts the user to choose between calculating a factorial or a power, then takes the necessary inputs.
